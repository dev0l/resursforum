# Project Resursforum
SuW/LiA/School-Project made by team Masusa to present ideas of changes to the existing website.

This application is based on MEAN. Git for version control/collaboration. Trello for collaboration:

	* MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/)
	* Express
	* Angular
	* Node
	* git (https://git-scm.com/)
	* Trello (https://trello.com/)

**Distinction**

The most interesting part about this project is the process, and watching the **progress** (check out the directory: _progress_ for all the documentation). 
Taking the leading position of the project, and since it was school related, my goal was for everyone to learn as much as possible about the process of making team-based web projects. 
With reference to SCRUM i made the process possible regardless of knowledge and experience within the team. Everybody contributed equally and made an amazing effort. 
The final result was never deployed and is now deprecated but the progress forever lasts in our memory.

Thank you Team Masusa!
